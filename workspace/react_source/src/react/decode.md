## 关键概念

- HostComponent: jsx 引用的原生标签称为HostComponent: div, span 这些
- update的概念：源码中，创建新的组件，state和props变化引发的更新都是一个个update， 通过`enqueueUpdate`收集，见下面子标题
- fiberNode: React组件和原始HTML元素都会创建


## update是如何存储执行的
每个`FiberNode`上都有一个`updateQueue`，这个字段收集此节点上要执行的所有更新，此队列是一个环形链表



## 用户事件中setState

触发事件 -> （执行setState的逻辑 -> 创建 newtask 插入到 taskQueue中） -> 事件tail, 尝试清空syncTaskQueue（调用taskQueue 

## FiberNode
```js
// A Fiber is work on a Component that needs to be done or was done. There can
// be more than one per component.
export type Fiber = {
  // These first fields are conceptually members of an Instance. This used to
  // be split into a separate type and intersected with the other Fiber fields,
  // but until Flow fixes its intersection bugs, we've merged them into a
  // single type.

  // An Instance is shared between all versions of a component. We can easily
  // break this out into a separate object to avoid copying so much to the
  // alternate versions of the tree. We put this on a single object for now to
  // minimize the number of objects created during the initial render.

  // Tag identifying the type of fiber.
  tag: WorkTag,

  // Unique identifier of this child.
  key: null | string,

  // The value of element.type which is used to preserve the identity during
  // reconciliation of this child.
  elementType: any,

  // The resolved function/class/ associated with this fiber.
  type: any,

  // The local state associated with this fiber.
  stateNode: any,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // parent : Instance -> return The parent happens to be the same as the
  // return fiber since we've merged the fiber and instance.

  // Remaining fields belong to Fiber

  // The Fiber to return to after finishing processing this one.
  // This is effectively the parent, but there can be multiple parents (two)
  // so this is only the parent of the thing we're currently processing.
  // It is conceptually the same as the return address of a stack frame.
  return: Fiber | null,

  // Singly Linked List Tree Structure.
  child: Fiber | null,
  sibling: Fiber | null,
  index: number,

  // The ref last used to attach this node.
  // I'll avoid adding an owner field for prod and model that as functions.
  ref:
    | null
    | (((handle: mixed) => void) & {_stringRef: ?string, ...})
    | RefObject,

  refCleanup: null | (() => void),

  // Input is the data coming into process this fiber. Arguments. Props.
  pendingProps: any, // This type will be more specific once we overload the tag.
  memoizedProps: any, // The props used to create the output.

  // A queue of state updates and callbacks.
  updateQueue: mixed,

  // The state used to create the output
  memoizedState: any,

  // Dependencies (contexts, events) for this fiber, if it has any
  dependencies: Dependencies | null,

  // Bitfield that describes properties about the fiber and its subtree. E.g.
  // the ConcurrentMode flag indicates whether the subtree should be async-by-
  // default. When a fiber is created, it inherits the mode of its
  // parent. Additional flags can be set at creation time, but after that the
  // value should remain unchanged throughout the fiber's lifetime, particularly
  // before its child fibers are created.
  mode: TypeOfMode,

  // Effect
  flags: Flags,
  subtreeFlags: Flags,
  deletions: Array<Fiber> | null,

  // Singly linked list fast path to the next fiber with side-effects.
  nextEffect: Fiber | null,

  // The first and last fiber with side-effect within this subtree. This allows
  // us to reuse a slice of the linked list when we reuse the work done within
  // this fiber.
  firstEffect: Fiber | null,
  lastEffect: Fiber | null,

  lanes: Lanes,
  childLanes: Lanes,

  // This is a pooled version of a Fiber. Every fiber that gets updated will
  // eventually have a pair. There are cases when we can clean up pairs to save
  // memory if we need to.
  alternate: Fiber | null,

  // Time spent rendering this Fiber and its descendants for the current update.
  // This tells us how well the tree makes use of sCU for memoization.
  // It is reset to 0 each time we render and only updated when we don't bailout.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  actualDuration?: number,

  // If the Fiber is currently active in the "render" phase,
  // This marks the time at which the work began.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  actualStartTime?: number,

  // Duration of the most recent render time for this Fiber.
  // This value is not updated when we bailout for memoization purposes.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  selfBaseDuration?: number,

  // Sum of base times for all descendants of this Fiber.
  // This value bubbles up during the "complete" phase.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  treeBaseDuration?: number,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // workInProgress : Fiber ->  alternate The alternate used for reuse happens
  // to be the same as work in progress.
  // __DEV__ only

  _debugSource?: Source | null,
  _debugOwner?: Fiber | null,
  _debugIsCurrentlyTiming?: boolean,
  _debugNeedsRemount?: boolean,

  // Used to verify that the order of hooks does not change between renders.
  _debugHookTypes?: Array<HookType> | null,

## tagType

```js
  var FunctionComponent = 0;
  var ClassComponent = 1;
  var IndeterminateComponent = 2; // Before we know whether it is function or class

  var HostRoot = 3; // Root of a host tree. Could be nested inside another node.

  var HostPortal = 4; // A subtree. Could be an entry point to a different renderer.

  // jsx 引用的原生标签称为HostComponent
  var HostComponent = 5;
  var HostText = 6;
  var Fragment = 7;
  var Mode = 8;
  var ContextConsumer = 9;
  var ContextProvider = 10;
  var ForwardRef = 11;
  var Profiler = 12;
